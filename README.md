# Access to Urban Infrastructure: Who Benefits?

The objective of this study is to employ a data driven approach to assess equity in accessibility within major Canadian cities. In order to do so, pedestrian accessibility to seven distinct categories of urban amenities ("mobility", "active living", "nightlife", "food choices", "community space", "education", "health wellbeing") is measured for city. In addition, we combine Canadian census data with unsupervised learning to extract “social profiles” of canadian populations that exist within each city. Finally, we assess equity in urban livability by comparing pedestrian accessibility to urban amenities between social groups.
